Apps
====

This folder holds the application development for apps on each of the major
platforms. Currently we only have a Windows Phone app. Neither the Android nor
iOS APIs provide sufficient access to the camera hardware for our application.
In particular, we require the ability to manually set exposure time and ISO
values.

Winphone
--------

Our windows phone application is very alpha-quality, but is capable of capturing
images that work in our system.

Android
-------

The rumored Android 5 camera APIs look like they may provide access to these
camera settings. We will look into developing an Android app when that becomes
available.

iOS
---

iOS does not provide access to image capture settings nor do we know if/when
Apple is planning to add these APIs. If they ever do, we will consider an iOS
app as well.
